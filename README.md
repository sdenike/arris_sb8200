# Arris SB8200 data logger

I had issues with Comcast stating that issues I was having with my internet was due to my hardware, I setup a script to scrape the Modem status page and log all data to a database.  With this I was able to show the tech that there was a signal issue causing problems with my connection.

This is a crude, get it to work script which I plan on improving on as time allows, but still may be helpful for others that need to log down the signal and channels information to prove your case to Comcast or other ISP's that wish to point the finger in your direction instead of taking time to look into their network.
